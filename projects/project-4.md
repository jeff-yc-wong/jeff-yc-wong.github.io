summary: This is my final project that I did with my group for ICS 314 to provide UH students with a platform for exchanging books
---

TextXchange is the web application my team and I build using Meteor, Semantic UI, JavaScript and React which are all frameworks/languages we learned in ICS 314. This web application strive to provide a user-friendly experience for UH system's student to purchase or sell textbooks that they use for class.

For this project I worked mostly in the backend of the application, such as implementing the search filtering, edit books, email verification and admin functionality. This project really helped develop my skill in data management and functional programming and introduced me to Agile Project Management by utilizing GitHub Project Board.
