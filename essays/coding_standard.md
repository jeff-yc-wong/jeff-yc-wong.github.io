Coding standards, coding styles, coding coventions are all words to represent a set of guidelines for writing quality code that is clean and neat, writing quality code has many benefits, from making it readable for others and yourself all the way to even pointing out potential mistakes or improvement that you can implement to your code. In this class, we are using the IDE, IntelliJ IDEA, with a code quality tool called ESLint, although we are currenly writing small non-collaborative projects, coding styles might not seem to be extremely important since no one is reading it but it's actually extremely useful in learning how to code, because it can help to remind you if a variable was unchanged therefore you can use const to ensure that the variable stays unchange or it might give you an error saying that a line of code is reductant and that it is not needed, which could help to condense your code.

To understand the importance of coding using coding standards we must imagine what would happen if coding standards were not applied, In this following example:
