Coding standards, coding styles, coding coventions are all words to represent a set of guidelines for writing quality code that is clean and neat, writing quality code has many benefits, from making it readable for others and yourself all the way to even pointing out potential mistakes or improvement that you can implement to your code. In this class, we are using the IDE, IntelliJ IDEA, with a code quality tool called ESLint, although we are currenly writing small non-collaborative projects, coding styles might not seem to be extremely important since no one is reading it but it's actually extremely useful in learning how to code, because it can help to remind you if a variable was unchanged therefore you can use const to ensure that the variable stays unchange or it might give you an error saying that a line of code is reductant and that it is not needed, which could help to condense your code.

To understand the importance of coding using coding standards we must imagine what would happen if coding standards were not applied, In this following example:

You can see that this block of code is already pretty unreadable, now imagine 100,000 lines of code that is the same as this one blob of code, first it would be extremely hard to debug your code since you would not be able to pinpoint a certain line of code to find the bug because there are lines of code that are bunched up together, secondly if you were in a collaborative setting, it would be virtually impossible for another person to read and understand what's going on since it looks like some blob of code mushed together, in contrast the following image shows an example of neat, quality code that is easy to understand:
