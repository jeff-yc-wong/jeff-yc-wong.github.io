From the reading of Eric Raymond's "<a href = "http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How To ask questions the smart way<a>", I learned about how important it is to format your questions in a smart way because it is true that there are no dumb questions but it depends on how you ask it, I learned that the way you format your question should show that you have done some extensive searches before asking the question, provide explicit detail in what you want and the place that the error is occuring when asking your question and that you are sincere in asking your question and make the question as easiest as possible for the readers/hackers to understand. From the reading, I also learned that  formating your question correctly is not the only important aspect of asking a smart question, but it also depends on where you ask it, when asking questions, you must make sure that u are asking the question on the related channel/forum so that your question can be properly answered.
  
  To demonstrate the differences between a "smart" question and a not so smart one, I have found two different example on <a href= "https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>:
  
 In this example, <a href= "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57920268/vb-net-web-application-with-webform-page-add-webapi-2-2"><img class="ui large right floated image" src="../images/Annotation 2019-09-12 225856.jpg"></a>
