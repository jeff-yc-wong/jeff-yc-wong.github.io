## Idea
UH Manoa's own Eventbrite

## Overview

<p>
  <strong>Problem:</strong> There are too many events from different communites that goes on at UH and there are no centralize area for student 
          to view all the events.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Solution:</strong> We would like to create a website that allows student to view all the events that goes on at UH Manoa and 
          allow them to sign up or purchase a ticket for the event if it's required.
</p>

## Case Ideas
