ICS 314 was definitely one of the most eye opening course that I took through my 1.5 years through Computer Science at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa at , it not only taught me what Software Engineering is but also a lot of other topics such as Open Source Software Development, Issue Driven Project Management and more, through this class I got a taste of what it would be like to code in the real world and not in a classroom environment due to the idea of Athletic Software Engineering. So let's get into some of the most interesting and important concepts that I leaned from this class.

# Functional Programming
The concept of functional programming was probably my favorite thing that I learned in ICS 314, the idea that I can pass functions as parameters are so crazy! It not only allow us to make functions that are more flexible in nature, meaning I can build a vague function that does everything that is essential, but then have a function as a parameter that specify more on what's going to happen and the specific parameters and steps that I am going to take, not only does functional programming provide that ability to make flexible functions but it also adds the idea of mutable variables, meaning that we don't have to define the type of the variable when we are initializing it, which makes it a lot easier because a variable that I initialize can become anything (It can go from a String to an Integer) thus saving me a lot of brain energy (Which I already have so little of) trying to remember what variable is of what type. With functional programming in JavaScript, I feel that I can allocate more of brain power to the functionality of my program because 1) I don't have to worry about syntax and 2) I don't have to worry about variable types. Even though Object-Oriented Programming language like C# and Java are currently more popular, I do see that functional programming might have the potential to one day rise to the top.
