<h1> Even Websites need makeup sometimes</h1>
 Aren't you sick of boring plain html website, well Semantic UI is here to save the day. Semantic UI is much like makeup in the way that helps to make plain old boring html website to something beautiful and presentable (I am not saying that there aren't any people who look beautiful and presentable without makeup just in case if I offened anyone then I am truly sorry). I am just going to throw this out there, in my journey through learning Sematic UI, I hated every it, I felt that it was extremely complicated and stressful especially when things inside a container can sometimes go outside of a container (How does that even work?).
